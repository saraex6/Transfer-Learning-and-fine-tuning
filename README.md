# Transfer Learning and-fine-tuning
This repo provides an implementation of transfer learning based on [Keras Applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/) for the clasification of plants deficiency. Current codes include:

* VGG16
* ResNet-50
* Inception-V3

You can easily apply TL on any [available pre-trained deep learning models](https://keras.io/api/applications/#available-models)
